            This was the year I took my first real step into the world of web development.
I began learning the building blocks of the web ‚Äî HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî and started creating small yet functional websites.
<br />
From writing my first {`<div>`} to styling layouts with CSS and adding interactivity through JS, I slowly started turning ideas into visual experiences.
<br />
I spent countless hours exploring the browser console, breaking things, fixing them, and learning by doing.
<br />
This phase not only taught me the core fundamentals of frontend development but also made me realize how much I enjoy solving problems and building user-friendly interfaces.

       After completing my diploma in Electrical & Electronics Engineering, I took the leap and joined Ramgarh Engineering College for B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering.
<br />
This was the year I fully embraced my passion for development ‚Äî I shifted my focus to building full-stack web applications using React, Next.js, Node.js, and Firebase.
<br />

From frontend finesse to backend logic, I started crafting projects that weren‚Äôt just visually appealing but also functionally solid. I explored component-driven architecture, API design, and deployment workflows.
<br />

This transition marked a major shift ‚Äî from just learning tech to actually shipping real, impactful solutions.

2025 has been all about turning skills into meaningful products.
I launched my developer portfolio ‚Äî consoleAditya.dev ‚Äî a reflection of my journey, skills, and coding style.
<br />
This year, I also built and launched one of my favorite personal projects: webdev-power-kit, a modular toolkit packed with powerful browser utilities and developer-centric features. It was built with scalability, clean code architecture, and an open-source mindset.
<br />

From idea to execution, I focused on creating things that are useful, well-documented, and ready to help others in the dev community.
<br />
This phase truly shaped my identity as a full-stack developer who doesn&apos;t just build projects ‚Äî but crafts experiences.
